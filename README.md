# HAProxy Documentation Converter

Made to convert the HAProxy documentation into HTML.

More than HTML, the main goal is to provide easy navigation.

## Documentations

A bot periodically fetches last commits for HAProxy 1.4 and 1.5 to produce up-to-date documentations.

Converted documentations are then stored online :
- HAProxy 1.4 Configuration Manual : [stable](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.4.html) / [snapshot](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/snapshot/configuration-1.4.html)
- HAProxy 1.5 Configuration Manual : [stable](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html) / [snapshot](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/snapshot/configuration-1.5.html)

## Contribute

The project now lives by itself, as it is sufficiently useable. But I'm sure we can do even better.
Feel free to report feature requests or to provide patches !
